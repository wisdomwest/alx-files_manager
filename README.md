Back-end
JavaScript
ES6
NoSQL
MongoDB
Redis
NodeJS
ExpressJS
Kue

This project is a summary of this back-end trimester: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.

The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:

User authentication via a token
List all files
Upload a new file
Change permission of a file
View a file
Generate thumbnails for images
You will be guided step by step for building it, but you have some freedoms of implementation, split in more files etc… (utils folder will be your friend)

Of course, this kind of service already exists in the real life - it’s a learning purpose to assemble each piece and build a full product.

Enjoy!

TASK DESCRIPTIONS:

TASK 0: Redis utils
mandatory
Inside the folder utils, create a file redis.js that contains the class RedisClient.

RedisClient should have:

the constructor that creates a client to Redis:
any error of the redis client must be displayed in the console (you should use on('error') of the redis client)
a function isAlive that returns true when the connection to Redis is a success otherwise, false
an asynchronous function get that takes a string key as argument and returns the Redis value stored for this key
an asynchronous function set that takes a string key, a value and a duration in second as arguments to store it in Redis (with an expiration set by the duration argument)
an asynchronous function del that takes a string key as argument and remove the value in Redis for this key
After the class definition, create and export an instance of RedisClient called redisClient.

TASK 1: MongoDB utils
mandatory
Inside the folder utils, create a file db.js that contains the class DBClient.

DBClient should have:

the constructor that creates a client to MongoDB:
host: from the environment variable DB_HOST or default: localhost
port: from the environment variable DB_PORT or default: 27017
database: from the environment variable DB_DATABASE or default: files_manager
a function isAlive that returns true when the connection to MongoDB is a success otherwise, false
an asynchronous function nbUsers that returns the number of documents in the collection users
an asynchronous function nbFiles that returns the number of documents in the collection files
After the class definition, create and export an instance of DBClient called dbClient.

TASK 2: First API
mandatory
Inside server.js, create the Express server:

it should listen on the port set by the environment variable PORT or by default 5000
it should load all routes from the file routes/index.js
Inside the folder routes, create a file index.js that contains all endpoints of our API:

GET /status => AppController.getStatus
GET /stats => AppController.getStats
Inside the folder controllers, create a file AppController.js that contains the definition of the 2 endpoints:

GET /status should return if Redis is alive and if the DB is alive too by using the 2 utils created previously: { "redis": true, "db": true } with a status code 200
GET /stats should return the number of users and files in DB: { "users": 12, "files": 1231 } with a status code 200
users collection must be used for counting all users
files collection must be used for counting all files
